# odin-recipes
Played around the Odin Recipe Project and this is what I have learned so far:
I can easily type the HTML boilerplate
I have familiarised myself with how absolute and relative links work.
I understand the git workflow better.
Learned how VSCode Terminal works with respect to git workflow.
I got to use the "alt" attribute while working with images.
Etc.
