    <h3>Preparation Steps</h3>
        
        <p>You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this tried-and-true Ghana Jollof Rice:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Add onions and 2 tablespoons of oil to a blender and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and habanero pepper to the blender, and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a separate medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining ⅓ cup (80 ml) of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is shimmering, add the onion puree and cook until the water has cooked out and the puree is starting to brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomato puree and add the curry powder, garlic powder, ginger, dried herbs, and crushed bouillon cubes. Cook for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the stew has reduced by half and is deep red in color.</li>
            <li>Add the rice, mixed vegetables, and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with foil and a lid. Simmer for another 30 minutes, until the rice is cooked through and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
